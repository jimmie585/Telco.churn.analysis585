Churn Analysis with Geospatial Insights

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn and visualize the locations of customers who are most likely to churn using geospatial data. The dataset includes customer attributes along with their latitude and longitude, allowing for insightful mapping of churned customers.

🏗️ Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and handling missing values in the dataset.

Churn Prediction: Using machine learning models to predict customer churn.

Geospatial Analysis: Mapping churned customers using latitude and longitude coordinates.

Interactive Visualization: Displaying churn hotspots on a map using folium.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for customers

Churn Label: Indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0)

Latitude, Longitude: Customer location coordinates

Other customer-related features (e.g., usage behavior, demographics, etc.)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, folium, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
